						<p>This Message Generator is designed to work with messages in groups of 5. This means that using a message like "12345 56789" is recommended.</p>
						<p>Using more than 5 numbers in a group may cause glitches to occur, and I've never seen a numbers station use more than groups of 5 anyways.<p>
						<p>If you want to use a trennung to divide message groups, I recommend using the follow format: "12345_/_67890" in which the underscore is a space. / may not work in some languages. If this is the case, a error sound will be played.</p>
						<p>Info on this per langauge will show up on the sound board page.</p>

				<h3>What is a numbers station?</h3>
				<p>Numbers stations are mysterious radio stations that broadcast numbers in various formats at seemingly regular intervals. The Conet Project,
				one of the largest collections of recorded numbers stations, describes them as "radio broadcasts that appear in
				the Shortwave bands twenty-four hours a day, on many different frequencies. They are used to transmit short text messages."</p>
				<a href="audio-samples/bbcr4-short.wav">Click here to hear a short exerpt from the BBC radio program "Tracking the Lincolnshire Poacher" which explains what Numbers Stations are</a>
				<br>
				
				<h3>What is the purpose of these "numbers stations"?</h3>
				<p>The common belief among shortwave radio enthusiasts is that these stations are used to broadcast news/inteligence to spies in foreign countries. In at least one case (S05 OLX) this has been confirmed to be true. The Czech government has had no fear in admitting to running their station to send inteligence out to agents in the field.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h3>How many langauages do these stations broadcast in? If there are more than two, why do you only have two languages available to use in the generator?</h3>
				<p>Numbers stations broadcast in many, many languages. English, German, and Slavic are the major langauges. As for the second question, it is very hard to get clear audio samples for each station, and I put in the clips I could put in that weren't being buzzed out</p>
				<br>
				
				<h3>Why do people (and you) find such an interest in these stations?</h3>
				<p>People are intrigued by these stations because they are strange stations that really have yet to be explained or even confirmed by the governments that people believe to broadcasting them</p>
				<br>
				
				<h3>What are some of your favorite numbers stations?</h3>
				<p>My favorite stations have to be the Lincolnshire Poacher, Swedish Rhapsody, and Gongs and Chimes. Sadly, most of these stations have been off the air for decades. Sound files of these can be found in the "Links" tab.</p>
				<p>The Lincolnshire Poacher is the first station I had heard of, and it is probably the most famous of them all.</p>
				<p>I always find Swedish funny since its call-sign sounds like an ice cream truck, but then begins this creepy voice. I imagine it scared many kids.</p>
				<p>Gongs and Chimes was a channel that had a call-sign which was a tape of a bell being struck 8 times. This is clear in the earlier recordings of this station (in the early 80's), but by the early 90's when the station met it's end, the recording has been stretched to the point it sounds extremely sinster. To make it better the final transmission, on May 9, 1990, was the station operators who seem to be drunk, singing a German kids song. What a way to go out.</p>
